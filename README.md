# SiriusXM Service Activation Guide

This is ONLY a proof of concept. I do not condone piracy or illegal activities. Please purchase SXM if you intend to use it on a regular basis. 

If you wish to be activated, please create an issue with your radio ID and car brand. (IMPORTANT) If this is my second time activating it for you, please state that in the issue.

## Private Method

It appears that SiriusXM has been frequently updating their systems, so I'll keep this method private. NEVER SHARE YOUR VIN PUBLICLY, I will assist you free of charge. Be cautious of anyone asking for payment or donations upfront, as this is likely a scam. However, this repo is not meant to attack anyone doing that, but provide an alternative. Who knows, maybe they've found a better method.

There is no guarantee that this method will work for everyone. I have successfully used it for both my Mom and Dad's cars, but results may vary for specific cases.

## Terms

Please note that this method may work more than once but less than twice, especially if SiriusXM implements new patches. Avoid repeatedly requesting activations. Additionally, do not ask me to share the activation satellite method. Access to this service by SiriusXM employees or researches is prohibited.

## Internet SXM Method

Root your device and then clone the SXM app using Lucky Patcher. Obtain another free trial by using a secondary or burner Gmail account.
